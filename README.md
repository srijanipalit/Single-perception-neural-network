This is my first active repository where I will implement a single perception neural network for linear regression. 

# Single-perception-neural-network
Neural network with a single perceptron and one/two input nodes for simple/multiple linear regression

## Libraries:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Methodology 
This is how I did it
